# Run a Simple Backtest Loop

In this tutorial, you'll build a minimal backtester that simulates a basic strategy using **RSI** to enter and exit trades. 
This helps you understand how strategy logic behaves over time.

---

## 💡 Strategy Rules

- **Enter trade** when RSI < 30 (oversold)
- **Exit trade** when RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Only one open position at a time
- Track and log entry/exit and P&L

---

## Step 1: Setup

Ensure `centaur_technical_indicators` is in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
centaur_technical_indicators = "1.0"
```

---

## Step 2: Calculate RSI

```rust 

use centaur_technical_indicators::momentum_indicators::bulk::relative_strength_index;
use centaur_technical_indicators::ConstantModelType::ExponentialMovingAverage;

pub fn main() {
    // [...]
    let rsi = relative_strength_index(&prices, ExponentialMovingAverage, 5).unwrap();
}
```

---

## Step 3: Backtest loop

```rust
pub fn main() {
    // [...]
    let mut in_position = false;
    let mut entry_price = 0.0;

    for i in 5..prices.len() {
        let price = prices[i];
        let rsi_val = rsi[i - 5];

        if !in_position && rsi_val < 30.0 {
            in_position = true;
            entry_price = price;
            println!("BUY at index {}: price = {:.2}, RSI = {:.2}", i, price, rsi_val);
        } else if in_position && rsi_val > 70.0 {
            in_position = false;
            let profit = price - entry_price;
            println!("SELL at index {}: price = {:.2}, RSI = {:.2}, Profit = {:.2}", i, price, rsi_val, profit);
        }
    }
}
```
